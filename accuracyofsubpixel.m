function [ output_args ] = accuracyofsubpixel( im ,listmax )
%UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

% this is part 3.3
% figure out accuracy and precision by
%   overlay result from 3.2 with SyntheticImg from 3.1
%   find distance difference between their maxima?
nummax=length(listmax)  % Is listmax == list of maxima's coordinates?
for i=1:nummax
    for j=1
end
