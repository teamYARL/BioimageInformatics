The related code for each question is as follows 

Part 2
B 2.1: getbackgroundinfo.m 
B 2.2: detectlocalmaxmin.m
B 2.3: triangulationproject.m
B 2.4: tTest.m
          trianglemean.m

Part 3
B 3.1: detectlocalmaxmin_inputMatrix.m 
          generatesyntheticimg.m
B 3.2: gaussianfit.m  
          interp.m
B 3.3: accuracyofsubpixel.m


For each test, you can run it to check the results
Run testpart2.m to check all the results for part 2
Run testpart3.m to check all the results for part 3.1,
test32 to check the result of part 3.2

In the result file, it contains the images got all the way until 3.2, which includes localMaxs,localMins,
filtered local maximums and sub-pixel detection result.

For other tests, they would test their related problem
